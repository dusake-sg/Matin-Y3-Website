      <p>Psychedelics have been used in religious ceremonies, spiritual rituals, and healing modalities for centuries. Today, they’re finally earning much-deserved attention as a complementary treatment to help ease mental health conditions and improve overall well-being.
      <br><br>
      The therapeutic benefits of psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin and ketamine, are currently being studied by leading institutions like NYU Langone Health and Johns Hopkins Medicine, with promising results.
      <br><br>
      For example, in one 2021 study, 67 percent of participants with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) who underwent therapy with the psychoactive drug MDMA no longer qualified for a PTSD diagnosis after 2 months of treatment. By contrast, only 32 percent of the participants in the placebo group had this result. That's twice as many people experiencing major relief — all thanks to a psychedelic compound.
      <br><br>
      With clinical studies underway, celebrities openly sharing their experiences, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approving psychedelic pharmaceuticals like esketamine, more people are gaining interest in how psychedelics can heal on an individual and collective level.</p>
