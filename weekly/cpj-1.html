      <p>My summer and bank account were kept busy with my internship but I had thoughts when revisiting my research topic.</p>

    <div class="col col-text">
      <p>Wayfinding was an area of design that didn’t excite me anymore but after rereading my compendium, I found that there was an opportunity to do something within the healthcare sector still.
      <br><br>
      Based on some light reading, I decided to amend my angle—instead of tackling a brief of “creating a better wayfinding for hospitals", I’m deciding to “create something that would ease anxiety in a sterile environment”. Although similar in context, it provides me with more breathing room to diverge before converging. And more importantly, it doesn’t reduce me to just creating another branded wayfinding system (I recognise that this on its own is not an easy task).
      <br><br>
      Thursday sharing session gave me my next steps forward; that is to inquire with people who’ve had recent experiences in the hospital with regards to wayfinding and to gather a list of visual references to aid in my search for (for a lack of a better term) a better thing to make.

    <h8>Readings</h8>
    <p>I’m currently reading two books for further research into humanising tech. Hopefully, that leads me to write more for my dissertation and helps me move in the right direction. 
    </p>

    <h8>Enquiries</h8>
    <p>I have a bunch of friends working in the health sector, so I’m hoping to shed some light on what it actually feels like in hospitals. However, I’m not sure what exactly to ask so I’ll have to write my enquiries down first.
    </p>

    <h8>Observation</h8>
    <p>I also am interested in how it feels like to visit a hospital for the first time. To experience this, I’m considering visiting a hospital and noting down my thoughts and getting in contact with individuals who have been to hospitals. 
      <br><br>
      More importantly, I would prefer to get a subject who’s early into their hospital experience and follow them closely to gauge how things change over.
    </p>

    <h8>Visual Reference</h8>
    <p>
      Aside from that, I’m also browsing three different books to look for visual references as to what’s already been done within the tech+wayfinding space. Refer to image below.

    <h7>What<span>are</span><br>Psychedelics?</h7>
  </div>
  <p class="central-col">Psychedelics have been used in religious ceremonies, spiritual rituals, and healing modalities for centuries. Today, they’re finally earning much-deserved attention as a complementary treatment to help ease mental health conditions and improve overall well-being.
    <br><br>
    The therapeutic benefits of psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin and ketamine, are currently being studied by leading institutions like NYU Langone Health and Johns Hopkins Medicine, with promising results.
    <br><br>
    For example, in one 2021 study, 67 percent of participants with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) who underwent therapy with the psychoactive drug MDMA no longer qualified for a PTSD diagnosis after 2 months of treatment. By contrast, only 32 percent of the participants in the placebo group had this result. That's twice as many people experiencing major relief — all thanks to a psychedelic compound.
    <br><br>
    With clinical studies underway, celebrities openly sharing their experiences, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approving psychedelic pharmaceuticals like esketamine, more people are gaining interest in how psychedelics can heal on an individual and collective level.</p>

  <p class="quote-left">Contrary to what was often taught in many high school awareness programs in the United States during the War on Drugs era, a growing body of evidence suggests that psychedelics may be 'quite safe and incredibly effective medicines.'</p>
