        Stress is the process by which a person reacts to a circumstance that challenges or threatens their well-being psychologically, physically, and frequently with behaviour (Baum et al., 1985 qtd in Ulrich 202). Avoidance behaviour, for example, involves the consumption of alcohol or cigarettes. Typical stressors within healthcare spaces include dwindling health, fear of pain and the unknown (Dankner 2). Often times these factors get multiplied by the physical surroundings of hospitals, such as sterile waiting rooms.
        <br><br>
        Designs for healthcare spaces are typically functional, as seen in corridors and entrances that are extremely wide for moving hospital beds. While focused on effectiveness, hospital interiors have forgone aesthetics resulting in psychologically “hard” designs (Ulrich). These hard designs cause additional stress as they don’t suit the needs of hospital users, forming anxiety and increasing blood pressure. Additionally, stress has a major impact on health by increasing susceptibility to diseases, and reducing the rate of recovery.

    Hospitals are public environments that cater to the healing of individuals in need. Within that state of ailment, a number of stressors are known to lead to additional discomfort.
    <br><br>
    1. Psychological fears
    The worry of the illness itself, medical procedures, unfamiliarity with medical staff, equipment and the sterility of the hospital environment.
    <br><br>
    2. Physical complaints
    Bodily annoyances ranging from eye irritation to nausea caused by physical environmental nuances like lack of fresh air, irregular temperature control and bad smells.

    <h8>Unfamiliarity</h8>
    <p>
      With regards to unfamiliarity, Lim et al. notes that adjusting to such an environment is an essential part of visiting hospitals.
      Waiting areas, for example, become places of uncertainty as they are unsure of diagnosis, causing anxiety while waiting for consults. This is further heightened due to long waiting times.
    </p>

    <h8>Lack of Control</h8>
    <p>
      Anxiety in general is expected when one does not have control over a situation. Fear of suffering and death come to mind, making people feel uneasy and vulnerable. 
      <br><br>
      Hence, overcoming a new environment atop their personal medical issues can "exacerbate the negative impact of some co-occuring phycosocial stress".
