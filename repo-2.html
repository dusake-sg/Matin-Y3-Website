        According to Wohlwill, human well-being is usually better when their surroundings give some level of positive stimulation. 
        <br><br>
        As opposed to high stimulation levels from intense light and sounds, and low stimulation that may lead to boredom, an appropriate positive distraction allows patients to remove focus from worries and stressful thoughts.
        <br><br>  
        A recurring aspect of Ulrich's research surrounds the use of nature as Positive Distraction. In multiple studies, it's shown that exposure to nature has physiological and psychological benefits. This is backed up by data from lower blood pressure and general heightened moods from participants.

  <p class="central-col">
    Beyond nature, recent studies find that artistic interventions have garnered some level of improved moods and health.
    <br><br>
    With kaleidoscopes, children were distracted when receiving a shot. Televisions are commonly found in waiting rooms now, typically showing news or cable shows. However, murals have shown to reduce anxiety as compared to televisions or a blank wall in a waiting room.
    <br><br>
    Material choices such as wood in furniture have also provided calming effects on users.
    <br><br>
    With regards to art, however, it's important to note that abstract graphics have been found to confuse or frustrate individuals as they may have been seen as over-stimulating. 
    <br><br>
    Wiesenberg argues despite this, abstraction through the use of organic form and have whimsical qualities may still be appropriate. This is as long as they feel uplifting and hopeful.
